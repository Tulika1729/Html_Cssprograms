<h1> Blood cells </h1>

<p class="para1">A blood cell, also called a hematopoietic cell, hemocyte, or hematocyte, is a cell produced through hematopoiesis and found mainly in the blood. </p>

<h2> Red blood cells </h2>
<p class="para2">  Haemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that gives red <i>blood cells</i>. </p>
<p class="para3"> There is more than one hemoglobin gene: in humans, hemoglobin A (the main form of hemoglobin present) is coded for by the genes, HBA1, HBA2, and HBB.[24] The amino acid sequences of the globin proteins in hemoglobins usually differ between species. These differences grow with evolutionary distance between species. For example, the most common hemoglobin sequences in humans and chimpanzees are completely identical, without even single amino acid difference in both the alpha and the beta globin protein chains.[25][26]. Where as the difference between humans & gorilla hemoglobin of single aminoacid in alpha & single amino acid in beta chains. These differences grow larger between less closely related species.</p>
